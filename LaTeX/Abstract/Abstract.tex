\chapter {Abstract}

The purpose of this research was to find out information about the zinc and sulfuric acid reaction. I carried out several experiments to find out the order of the reactants and also to find out how effective different catalysts are at increasing the rate of this reaction. I found out that when a catalyst isn't present the sulfuric acid is second order, and when a catalyst is present, both the catalyst and acid are first order, making a second order reaction overall. This experiment was carried out in my college chemistry Laboratory at Long Road Sixth Form College. Inside this coursework, the document also includes in depth chemical ideas about relating topics as well as different ways to carry out the experiment I did.
