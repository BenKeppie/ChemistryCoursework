\section{Non-Catalysed Experiment Series}

In order to work out the order of sulfuric acid in the Zinc and sulfuric acid reaction I carried out an experiment without the presence catalyst. I varied the concentration of the sulfuric acid (6 series with a range of 2.0 Molar - 6.0 Molar) whilst keeping the mass of Zinc the same (1.0 g). My raw data tables can be seen below for each concentration of sulfuric acid.

\section{Different Catalysts Experiment Series}

After finishing my initial experiment, I began to think about how different catalysts affect the rate of reaction.
